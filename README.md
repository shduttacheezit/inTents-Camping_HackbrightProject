### What is inTentsLending?
inTentsLending is a web application that enables peer-to-peer sharing of camping gear. Lenders may upload their gear they would like to lend out.  Campers may search via their geolocation, brands, categories, keywords, and a different location and borrow desired items for a specific amount of time. This project's goal was to contribute to the information technology world's recent momentum in sharing economy, as collaborative consumption has become a great way to live and consume sustainably.

Once a camper logs in, the camper can see their dashboard, which geolocates the user. From here, the camper can search for gear. The search results will take a gear keyword, brand, category, or a desired zipcode.

## <a name="version2"></a>inTentsLending Version 2.0

In Version 2.0, there will be the ability to sign on using Facebook and GMail, so as to be able to lend and borrow through one's network to encourage trust and safety among borrows and lenders. There will also be a way to rate each gear item, the lender, as well as the borrower, so there is accountability among the users of this application.
